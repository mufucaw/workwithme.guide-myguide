## Values

* I don't steal other people's work.

* I cut through bullshit like a razor slices through Jello.

## Personality

* Respectful.
* Open to new ideas.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

* Just give it to me straight, I can't stand sugar-coating. ;)
* Please keep positive recognition short and sweet.

## Work Patterns

9-6 PT

I'll slay that specific code alone unless one of us needs help. Most architectural decisions are a joint effort but I'll
need time alone to think about my part(s).

## Communication Preferences

Slack me and ask to start a video chat if it's urgent or requires a more personal touch. Slack is perfect for small and
easy stuff. Video chat me for anything more complicated.

Please only reach out to me outside of work hours for urgent matters that require immediate attention.

When I'm concentrating hard and don't want to be interrupted, I'll let you know via slack straight away. :)

## How To Know Iâ€™ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

I get irritable and edgy. My answers will be shorter than usual and even more direct. I may ask questions out of frustration.

### How to help

Just say my safe word "carnitas" if you spot this behavior and I'll do my best to take a break.

## Me Being Me

I joke a lot but I NEVER intend to hurt anyone's feelings. Please let me know **immediately** if this happens and you'll find
me apologizing profusely.

## Career Goals & Future Interests

Hands-on IC architect.

## Areas for Development

Organization skills and, this is the big one, **impulsivity**! I'm working to be less impulsive but it's a huge challenge for
me.

## Ask Me About

Exoplanets and F.I.R.E
